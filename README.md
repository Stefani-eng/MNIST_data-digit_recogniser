# MNIST_data-digit_recogniser
This is my improved version of the original Digit Recognizer kernel from https://www.kaggle.com/yassineghouzam/introduction-to-cnn-keras-0-997-top-6/notebook

I changed:
* the kernerl sizes (3x3) instead of (5x5) and
* (1x1) instead of (3x3) in the CNN because the images are 28x28.

I got 96~97% testing accuracy in 3 epochs in comparison to less than 80% with the previous kernel size arrangement.
